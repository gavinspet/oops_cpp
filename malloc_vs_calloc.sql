Title: Comparison of malloc() and calloc() in C/C++

Introduction:
In C and C++, both malloc() and calloc() are used for dynamic memory allocation. 
However, they have some key differences in terms of usage and behavior.

1. malloc():
   - Function: malloc(size_t size)
   - Purpose: Allocates a specified number of bytes from the heap.
   - Initialization: Does not initialize the memory. Contains garbage values.
   - Example:
          
     int* myArray = (int*)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
          

2. calloc():
   - Function: calloc(size_t num_elements, size_t element_size)
   - Purpose: Allocates memory for a specified number of elements, each with a specified size.
   - Initialization: Initializes the allocated memory to zero.
   - Example:
          
     int* myArray = (int*)calloc(5, sizeof(int));
          

Key Differences:
- malloc() allocates a specific number of bytes, while calloc() allocates memory for elements, 
  taking both the number of elements and element size into account.
- malloc() does not initialize the memory, leading to unpredictable values in the allocated memory.
- calloc() initializes the allocated memory to zero, making it useful for arrays and structures.

Choosing between malloc() and calloc() depends on whether you need initialized memory and the 
specific use case.

Remember to check for allocation failure (returned pointer is not NULL) and free allocated memory 
to avoid memory leaks.

Conclusion:
Understanding the differences between malloc() and calloc() is crucial for effective memory 
management in C/C++. Each function has its own purpose and should be used accordingly.
