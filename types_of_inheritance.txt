1. Single inheritance - ek baap, ek beta

2. Multiple inheritance - do baap, ek beta (aise toh more than do bhi can do)

3. Multilevel inheritance - grandpa --> baap --> beta

4. Hierarchal inheritance -  baap --> beta1
                                  --> beta2
                                  --> beti1
                                  --> beti2
                                  --> beti3
                                  --> step-beta
                                  --> step-beti1

 5. Hybrid inheritance - two or more types of inheritance together

 6. virtual inheritance - i. Virtual inheritance is used to address ambiguity issues
                             that may arise in multiple inheritance scenarios.

                          ii. When a base class is virtually inherited, 
                          it ensures that only a single instance of that base 
                          class exists in the hierarchy, reducing ambiguity.
